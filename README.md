# Tradr

A program (soon to be) capable of (theoretically) trading shares

### Concept

Tradr tries to match a by you given trend to the current actual market trend.
If for instance a buy trend and the market trend match a buy / sell action will be executed.
Otherwise Tradr will wait one cycle and repeat the same again.

### Getting started

1. install the requirements as shown below
   > pip install -r requirements.txt
2. copy the config.json file to local.config.json and update it as needed.
3. run main.py
   > python -m app.main
