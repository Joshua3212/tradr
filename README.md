# Tradr

A program (soon to be) capable of (theoretically) trading shares

### Concept

Tradr tries to match a by you given buy trend to the actual market trend.
If that is the case tradr will purchase a stock, otherwise a sell / wait is the expected result.

### Getting started

1. install the requirements as shown below
   > pip install -r requirements.txt
2. copy the config.json file to local.config.json and update it as needed.
3. run main.py
   > python -m app.main
