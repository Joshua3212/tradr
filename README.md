# Tradr

A program (soon to be) capable of (theoretically) trading shares

### Concept

**Step 1:** Gather data on a stock (for the last **x** months / days / hours / etc)

**Step 2:** calculate the average trend for the stock

**Step 3:** If the trend in step 2 is positive consider the stock and check for the trend over the last week/day

**Step 4:** if the recent trend was positive somehow figure out how much to buy

**Step 5:** hopefully stonks

### Adapters

Adapters are integrations for stockbrokers like [Alpaca]("https://alpaca.markets/").
Those integrations are used to both get information about stocks / their current pricing and purchase / sell them
