# Tradr

A program (soon to be) capable of (theoretically) trading shares

### Concept

Predictions are entirely based on the trend (which is a bad idea)
basically a down-trend with a recent (small) up spike means a buy and the opposite is interpreted as a reason to sell

# Todo

- figure out a way to judge how many shares to buy
- figure out a way how many shares to sell
